# Project-Based Learning with Low-Cost Hardware using MATLAB Online

## Overview
This workshop serves as a resource for educators seeking to enhance experiential learning with MATLAB and Simulink in online, hybrid, and remote environments. By leveraging MATLAB Online in conjunction with affordable hardware, educators can offer students engaging projects and activities without the need for costly lab equipment, extensive software installations, or complex desktop configurations. The repository includes guidance on using MATLAB Online with low-cost hardware platforms, such as Arduino, and other devices via MATLAB Mobile and ThingSpeak, to facilitate project-based learning. It also provides instructions on connecting hardware to MATLAB Online and designing effective project-based learning activities for remote settings.

## Technical Requirements
It is recommended that Google Chrome&trade; be used for this workshop.

## Material Requirements
If you would like to follow along with all of the workshop activities, a basic Arduino kit is required. The below links are some options that are available online. <br /><br />
This workship will be recorded and available following the EXPO, so even if you do not have the materials or time required to perform every activity, you can consult this repository and the recording at a later time.   <br />
